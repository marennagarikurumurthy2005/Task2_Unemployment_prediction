## Unemployment Rate Analysis During Covid-19

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the unemployment rate, specifically its sharp increase during the Covid-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate is defined as the percentage of the labor force that is unemployed but actively seeking employment. This analysis aims to provide insights into how the pandemic has impacted unemployment and to identify patterns and trends over time.

### Objectives

- **Analyze Trends**: Explore how the unemployment rate has changed before, during, and after the Covid-19 pandemic.
- **Visualize Data**: Create visualizations to represent changes in the unemployment rate over time and across different regions.
- **Identify Patterns**: Examine any correlations between unemployment rate changes and other socio-economic factors during the pandemic.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build and evaluate predictive models to forecast future unemployment trends based on historical data.

### Data

The analysis utilizes unemployment data sourced from [reliable sources such as government databases, labor statistics, etc.]. The dataset includes variables such as:

- Date
- Unemployment Rate
- Region/Location
- Additional socio-economic indicators (e.g., GDP, sector-specific employment)

### Tools and Technologies

- **Programming Languages**: Python, R
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Data Sources**: [List of data sources or links to datasets]

### Results

- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts showing unemployment trends over time and by region.
- **Analysis**: Summary of findings and insights drawn from the data.
- **Models**: Description of predictive models and their performance metrics.
